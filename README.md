# imdb-project
A simple project to identify good movies for dinners

Data sources including:
  - imdb datasets: downloaded from https://datasets.imdbws.com/ in March 2021
  - Further data for movies, cast & crews (unavailable in imdb datasets above): collected by Python script (), using IMDbPY library

Some data analysis exercises were done, using Python () & SQL (), including:
  - Calculate Bayes average
  - etc.

Data visualization dashboard is created with Microsoft Power BI ()

Future planing for project:
  - Futher data analysis in Python with matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
  - Explore data modelling of movie information (plot, genres, cast, etc.) to recommend good movies, with ambition to learn and apply Natural Language Processing & Machine Learning frameworks
